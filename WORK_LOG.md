| September 24 | 11:17-11:55pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I started to code my binary search algorithm. I kept running into different bugs because I have forgotten how to code it from CS1, so it took a little bit of warming up to get going. |
| September 26 |  8:45-9:55pm  | I got most of it working, except I ran into one final bug. I was sure that it would work, but it just wouldn't pass the test. So, I added some print statements to see what was going on, and then I realized that I was adding the correctly spelled words to my array. So, I included a "found" variable which made it work! I also tried thinking of different ways not to have both an arraylist and an array, but I just couldn't think of a way around that. |

However, it does not return an array yet because I am still thinking about how I should go about turning a trie/tst into an array. Anyways, my plan for tonight is to get good progress on my trie class and hopefully get that working. |
