| September 24 |  11:17-11:am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I started to code my binary search algorithm. I kept running into different bugs because I have forgotten how to code it from CS1, so it took a little bit of warming up to get going. |
| September 26 |  8:45-9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I got most of it working, except I ran into one final bug. I was sure that it would work, but it just wouldn't pass the test. So, I added some print statements to see what was going on, and then I realized that I was adding the correctly spelled words to my array. So, I included a "found" variable which made it work! I also tried thinking of different ways not to have both an arraylist and an array, but I just couldn't think of a way around that. |
| October 5    |  8:00-8:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I created all of my classes and began building off the pseudocode from the slides to create code that would accomplish the goal if my insert and lookup methods worked. However, it does not return an array yet because I am still thinking about how I should go about turning a trie/tst into an array. Anyways, my plan for tonight is to get good progress on my trie class and hopefully get that working. |

| October 5    | 10:00-10:20pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I just realized that I wasn't even inserting letters into my trie before, and there was no need at all for a for loop to go through each character, since I could just index into it using the char value from each letter. So, I fixed it up a little bit, and I think that it works now, but I am not completely sure. |
| October 5    | 10:20-11:00pm | I started my lookup method by using another for loop that looped through every item in every node's list, which was really inefficient. I soon realized that I could just see if any character was null by indexing into it. If it was null, I could just return false instantly because that combination of letters simply doesn't exist in the dictionary. Otherwise, I could keep going through all the letters. Once I reached the final letter, I realized I didn't need an if statment, as I just had to return the isWord variable, which would tell whether a word is a word or just a segment, in one line. I'm sorry if this was hard to read. I also cleaned up my insert method. |
| October 6    | 11:00-11:55am |  I found a bug in my Node class that made it seem like my code was trying to insert an apostrophe into the trie, even though there were no apostrophes in any of the test cases. So, I ended up increasing the size of my node arrays to ajust it to all the ascii values. Because of this, I no longer need the < - 'a'>. I also found an easy way get all of the misspelled words into an array. I realized that instead of looking through the entire misspelled trie, I could just add the misspelled words into an arraylist at the same time that I was adding them to the misspelled trie. I also began the TST class, and made a new TSTNode class because each node needs a letter. |

I know that there is something wrong because it only sets a very small portion of the last letters of each word as true which doesn't really make sense. One thing that I think is missing, is that I need a while loop that runs until the letter has found a place to be inserted. Anyways, I don't really know what is going on anymore and I am a little bit lost. |
